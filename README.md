# My-WiFi

Get some IP-related basic info
------------------------------

This tool is only for covering your own IP adress, and 
some other basic ip and network related stuff. You can see 
the most used settings and info that you specific want all 
together instead of typing, 3,4 or even more times 
different commands to finally get the same amount and sort 
info you become here with this 'My_WiFi' app.

I hope you enjoy it, and if there are any specific 
questions, you can ans them in the git, on the main page.
